# joint_aoa_rss_positioning
This repository provides a customized implementation of the research paper: "Joint AOA-RSS Fingerprint-Based Localization for Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems".

The following MATLAB scripts are included for reproducing specific figures from the paper:

  CDF_err_with_diff_M.m : Generates Fig. 3 from the paper, illustrating the CDF of positioning error with varying numbers of AP antennas M for eta=5.
  
  CDF_err_with_diff_eta.m : Generates Fig. 4 from the paper, showing the CDF of positioning error for different values of RP intervals eta or M=8.
  
All variables and parameters have been closely aligned with the original paper to ensure reproducibility.
